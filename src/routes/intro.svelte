            Hello! I'm currently in my senior year at CU Boulder majoring in Computer Science. I believe in writing secure,
            accessible, responsive, and readable code. My experience in both security and software gives me a more holistic
            understanding of each field, and my extensive work in development teams has taught me how to collaborate with both
            team members and stakeholders. <a

            has been an incredible part of my time at CU and my main extracurricular. I've worked in various roles for this club including
            co-president, project lead, webmaster, outreach, and a project team member. This has improved my consulting and communication
            skills as we work directly with nonprofits throughout the year.
